# PlanoCartesiano

This simple program is intended to help you locate where each part of the Cartesian plane is, as the Cartesian plane is divided into four areas.
This program has no limit in the Cartesian plane, except that if one of the coordinates (x and y) receives the number 0, the program ends.
